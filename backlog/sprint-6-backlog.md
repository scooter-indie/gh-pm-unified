## Selected Stories

### Tech Story: Release Build & Distribution
**Points:** 5 | **Priority:** High

**Description:** Configure GoReleaser and GitHub Actions to build and publish the extension as installable releases.

**Benefit:** Users can install gh-pmu via `gh extension install` from published releases.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `.goreleaser.yml` configured for gh extension format
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow builds on tag push
- [ ] Produces binaries for linux/darwin/windows (amd64/arm64)
- [ ] Release includes checksums and changelog
- [ ] `gh extension install scooter-indie/gh-pmu` works from release
- [ ] README updated with installation instructions

**Technical Notes:**
- Use goreleaser archive format compatible with gh extension
- Binary must be named `gh-pmu` (matches extension name)
- Consider using `gh extension create` scaffold as reference
- Test installation locally before publishing
